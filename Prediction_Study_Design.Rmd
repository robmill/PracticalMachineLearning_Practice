```

## Prediction Study Design

1. Define your error rate
2. Split data into:
- Training, testing, validation
3. On the training set pick features
- Use cross-validation
4. On the training set pick prediction function
- Use cross-validation
5. If no validation
- Apply 1x to test set
6. If validation
- Apply to test set
- Apply 1x to validation

## Know the Benchmarks

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
